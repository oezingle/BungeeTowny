This directory was created by BungeeTowny, because chat was enabled in config.yml

Channels.yml and ChatConfig.yml are compatible with TownyChat. If you already have a configuration saved there, copy it here

Messages.yml are the messages player receives when doing a given action. If you're willing to help translate BungeeTowny, contact me!

BungeeTowny.yml is full of chat settings that BungeeTowny provides, outside of TownyChat's functionality
